//TODO:
Aim 1;
* implement tracking first
	- then implement PID controller to control tracking

notes on aim 1;
* implement basic forward tracking (on the x plane)...
* the ability to yaw track might be possible by measuring the x position from the centre of the screen then use pythagoras to measure the angle theta and thus the radians to yaw


Aim 2;
(if time remains)

notes on aim 2;


General;

TODO;
* include more AR stuff on the GUI, such as the flight details
	- give the ability to set important values such as max x, y and z velocity
* Draw the necessary lines on the screen for co-ordination help
